//2.Weather Description (Temperature Descriptions)
// Write a program that describes the temperature:

// If the temperature is exactly 0, log "It's freezing cold."
// If the temperature is exactly 15, log "It's a cool day."
// If the temperature is exactly 25, log "It's a pleasant day."
// If the temperature doesn't match any of these, log "Unknown weather."
